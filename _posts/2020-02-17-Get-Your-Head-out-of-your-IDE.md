The war cry of every Software Developer ever, "Lets start coding."

Should this change? Should we instead start to say, "Get your head out of the IDE."

Much too often coders spend all their time tackling problems more involved with the implementation than problems of design. And we all know that no matter how good you code the power only comes with the outward facing design. 

Usability is god in this new modern age, because the simple fact is that even if you have a 'fresh' new idea and the usability is poor, someone else with second mover advantage will make the same product with a better, more usable interface.

And if that doesn't motivate you enough, then remember the best products are always designed user first. 

Maybe I'm over-exaggerating the problem, but it is a problem that we all face.
