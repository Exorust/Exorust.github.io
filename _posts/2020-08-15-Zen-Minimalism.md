"If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything, it is open to everything."

## What is the problem?

Today's software is bloated. **And worse we've become accustomed to it.**
Take IDE's like Netbeans,Eclipse or Intellij IDEA, You have multiple panels open each containing some form of information. One panel on the top, on the bottom and one on each side. Maybe all this information is needed, yet could there have been a better way to show this?

You have to remember it was not always like this. Back during the origin of computers, both computation and memory were luxeries. Programmers had to spend most effort on optimization and not on user-quality. And maybe one can argue that this has led to a wrong approach to software building.

In an era of stale design perhaps minimalism offers us a way out. Similar to the 1920's with the rise of minimalism in architecture to 'cull' the complexity & 'meaning' stuffed into architecture. 

The rise of 'simpler' IDE's like Visual Studio Code and Atom are a testament to the shift. We can see this also in the packaging of applications more towards a 'web-app' or a 'cross-platform' application. Once upon a time web-apps were seen as a messaiah to increasing complex installers. 

However in our modern development we can see the 'bloat' start to increase. Platforms such as electron have allowed us to easily create cross platform applications but are incredibly heavy. Yet can we see that ease of development has lead to more beautiful aesthetics. Webpages are also becoming increasingly beautiful yet are becoming more and more heavy with javascript.

Are we to extrapolate, *ease of creation leads to higher focus on aesthetics but heavier applications?* And if so is that really a bad thing, as long as our applications are more user-oriented and more friendly?

Or is it time to go full minimalist and build software & phones like the lightphone? 
Maybe we can take inspiration from Zen art.

## Zen Art

Zen art has a long history in correlation with minimalism & beauty alike. Focus is placed on:

**1. Kanso: simplicity**

Steve jobs is well known for his simplistic designs. From the iPod trackwheel to the single click on Macbooks. Simplicity is a key fundamental to minimalism. 

**2. Koko: Austerity**

The goal for Koko is to present something that both appears spare and imparts a sense of focus and clarity. 

**3. Fukinsei: asymmetry, irregularity**

The goal of fukinsei is to convey the symmetry of the natural world through clearly asymmetrical and incomplete renderings. The effect is that the viewer supplies the missing symmetry and participates in the creative act.

**4. Shizen: Natural**

We all have a propensity towards nature. We want AR/VR we want nature wallpapers. Yet shizen, is to strike a balance between being “of nature” yet distinct from it.

**5. Yugen: subtly profound grace, not obvious**

The principle of yugen captures the Zen view that precision and finiteness are at odds with nature, implying stagnation and loss of life, and that the power of suggestion is often stronger than that of full disclosure. 

**6. Datsuzoku: unbounded by convention, free**

Datsuzoku signifies a certain reprieve from convention. When a well-worn pattern is broken, creativity and resourcefulness emerge. Breaking from conventions organic growth of camera's in phones have now destroyed the 'digital camera' that was once pervasive.

**7. Seijaku: tranquility**

The principle of seijaku deals with the actual content of datsuzoku. Can we make our apps focused yet not 'flashy' with notifications?


Perhaps replication of Minimalism in a Zen fashion may lead to more creative & user-intuitive applications. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's no need for any change. Let's see what the future holds for us!
