A mixture of multiple patterns help startups pioneer new business models. What are these? Surprisingly, a set of underlying principles allow these patterns to work. What are they?

## Patterns that lead to Innovative Business Models
Either intentionally or unintentionally, the business models of rapidly growing companies often follow proven patterns that tap into growth factors. One must also note that not all patterns are equal. Open source software is insanely sucessful, but most of the time fails to monetize to the same level.

### 1. Use Bits Rather than Atoms

Software bits are better than physical businesses because, you can serve a global and large markets easily. You can also design around growth limiters due to faster iterations of the product.

### 2. Platforms

Platforms lend huge power to the product. Platforms use network advantages to allow more users to come in. Companies like Microsoft used platforms to their advantage when they gave the internet explorer free with their operating system Windows. Platforms like iTunes take a 30% share of the proceeds from songs/movies/books.

### 3. Free or Freemium

'Free' has an irrational effect on humans. The incredible power of free makes it valuable for distribution and virality. You can offer a product for free and still be profitable, by using the advertising-driven business model. Both Facebook and Google make money through targeted ads.

'Freemium' also has a similar effect. Dropbox allows users to have 2GB of storage free, and for 'extra'/'special' storage they charge you.

### 4. Marketplaces

Marketplaces are some of the most sucessful buisness model possible, with the older Google, eBay and Amazon, and the newer Airbnb. These are powerful because they *tap into two-sided network effects*. Besides obvious advantages, the more efficient a marketplace is, the more value it creates, because that means more transactions might occur, creating value.

Google's AdWords marketplace allow anyone to bid on keywords, in any quantity, so that even the smallest business can tap into global distribution. Google also measures advertising quality, and the best ads are shown to more customers.

### 5. Subscriptions

With the advent of Salesforce and the Software-as-a-Service(SaaS) model, selling sofware as a subscription via the internet has changed how software used to be sold. As it turns out, SaaS became the dominant business model for enterprise software, since it allowed companies to sell the software not just to big companies but to small and medium enterprises as well.

Advantage of such a subscription model is that it cuts out field operations and allows greater & global distribution. Common exaples of Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have proven this model.

### 6. Digital goods

At the intersection of 'Bits rather that atoms' and platforms is the sale of digital goods. Intangible products that have no intrisic value, but can still make for a profitable business. Take the example of LINE, it derives significant revenue through the sale of 'stickers'. Over $270 million was made on stickers alone, which is over 1/4th of the total revenue of LINE.

### 7. Feeds

The pattern that drives most social networking nowadays is the idea of the news feed. Facebook's powerful network effects allow atraction of users, but users stay for the feed. The power of the news feed comes from its ability to drive user engagement.

## Underlying Principles that push Innovation

### 1. Moore's Law

[Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) is the fundamental idea that drives our computer industry. Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a integrated circuit doubles about every two years. In a simpler term, the computing power doubles about every two years. It appears that *the true limit to Moore's Law is human engineering ingenuity, not physics*.

Reed Hastings (founder of Netflix), had a vision of television on demand via the internet, but the technology wasn't ready for his vision. So, he shifted his vision to DVD's as a stopgap, because they were both compact and durable. So every 5 years, he kept checking if he could make his vision come true, he checked in 2002,2007, & by 2012 streaming was 60% of the business.

### 2. Automation

Computers are more faster,cheaper and reliable that computers. The improvements made in technology, are exponential compared to human improvements. This is because Moores law allows computers to double in improvements over every 18 months, where as human evolution takes course over millions of years.

Automation creates the productivity that is seen in Amazon's warehouses, or in Google Server Farms.

### 3. Adaption, not Optimization

Sucessful startups through the use of constant experiments, A/B tesing and growth hacking adapt to the market and create new business models more than optimize existing models.

Sucessful old factories were the ones who were the best at optimizing the existing processes. But the best modern startups are the ones that adapt and expand into new markets like how Amazon shifted into AWS, or how Facebook shifted from Website to Mobile app.


### 4. The Contrarian Principle

The crucial aspect of creating a valuable tech company is being a contrarian. If your company is pursuing a very attractive proposition, then you will have to spend a lot of effort distancing yourself from your competitors. But if your company is pursuing an opportunity that conventional wisdom ignores or disdains, then you have time to refine your business model and you can obtain good Product/Market fit.

Surprisingly, being contrarian doesn't mean that dumb people disagree with you, but it means that smart people disagree with you! The idea of business model innovation means that you are trying something new and unproven!
