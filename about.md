Hi I'm *Chandrahas Aroori*!

I currently am a senior pursuing my undergraduate in Computer Science in Bits Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

I am *interested in the intersection of Computer Science and the real world*. I want to work on *something that makes a difference* and can lead to changing of the existing paradigms.

I'm best at understanding the paradigms that make up computer science and integrating them to the real world.

I am a big believer of [Thoreau's quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2690-i-went-to-the-woods-because-i-wished-to-live), "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.". My favourite poem is ["Do Not Go gentle into that good night"](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night), by Dylan Thomas. Give it a read if you like poetry. :)
