#### " Everyone who wasn't an idealistic fool when young hasn't lived.
#### Anyone who isn't a realist hasn't lived.
#### But one who becomes an idealist after being trapped as a realist changes the world."

Hi, and welcome I'm ***Chandrahas Aroori***!

As a human, I think we need to ask ourselves, "Did I leave this world better than when I came in?"

I am *interested in the intersection of Computer Science and the real world*.

I want to work on *something that makes a difference* and can lead to changing of the existing paradigms.

I'm best at understanding the paradigms that make up computer science and integrating them to the real world.

If I'd summarize why I love coding it would be: "Uncertainty in coding means you can mold the situation to whatever you want. It is completely upto your design, your ingenuity!"

I am a big believer of [Thoreau's quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2690-i-went-to-the-woods-because-i-wished-to-live), *"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."*

My favourite poem is ["Do Not Go gentle into that good night"](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night), by Dylan Thomas. Give it a read if you like poetry. :)
